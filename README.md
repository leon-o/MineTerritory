# Territory Mod of Minecraft
A territory mod based on Forge (currently).

## Introduction

Compared with other mod and plugins, it has the following features:

1. Ensure the gameplay and try not to damage the original feel of MC. The territory table and enchanting table are brothers:smirk:
2. GUI interface.Players can configure permissions, territory area and territory name through GUI.
3. Divide territories by chunks. This is mainly for performance considerations. Get the coordinates of the chunk where the player is located, and check it in
 the Hash Map to determine if player has permission.

### How To Use

See [Wiki](https://github.com/leon-o/MineTerritory/wiki)

## Following Plan

The permissions part is a bit poor. There are only four permissions : enter, left-click, right-click, and territory management.:sweat_smile:

These permissions should be further subdivided in the future.

1.15 and 1.16 versions will be considered in the future.
